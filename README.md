## Hi, I'm Jared Gungap
- Iâ€™m currently learning ECE 205
- I'm originally from Hawaii, Waipahu
- I'm a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering
- I chose my major because I'm interested in electrical projects 
- A fun fact about me is I love to golf
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  Other than it being an elective class, I want to expand my skills in coding
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: Four Agreements

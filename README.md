## Hi, I'm Jared Gungap
Iâ€™m currently learning ECE 205
I'm originally from Hawaii, Waipahu
I'm a senior
I chose my major because I'm interested in projects that relate to electricity
A fun fact about me is I love to golf
What do I want to learn from EE 205?  Other than it's a elective class, I want to gain more knowledge in coding
A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Four Agreements
